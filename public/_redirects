# _redirects (for Cloudflare Pages)

# Rule 1: Redirect old .html query string paths to clean URLs (301 for SEO)
# This sends browsers/search engines to the new preferred URL
/series.html?mangaTitle=:slug /:slug 301
/reader.html?mangaTitle=:slug&chapterKey=:chapter /:slug/:chapter 301

# Rule 2: Optional: Redirect direct access to top-level .html files if they shouldn't be accessed directly
# This assumes your React app handles /series and /reader routes
/series.html / 301
/reader.html / 301

# Rule 3: The essential rule for SPAs - rewrite all unmatched paths to index.html
# This tells Cloudflare Pages to serve your main React app (index.html)
# for any route that isn't a direct static file match.
# Your React Router then takes over and handles the specific path.
/* /index.html 200
